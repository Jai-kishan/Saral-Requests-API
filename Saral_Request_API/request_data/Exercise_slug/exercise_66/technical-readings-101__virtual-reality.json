It uses software to produce images, sounds and other sensations to create a different place, so that a user feels like he or she is really a part of this other place. That other place can be a real place (to take a tour in another country, for instance) or imaginary (playing a game).\nMost current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either on a computer screen or through special stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones.\nThe simplest form of virtual reality is a 3-D image that can be explored interactively at a personal computer, usually by manipulating keys or the mouse so that the content of the image moves in some direction or zooms in or out. More sophisticated efforts involve such approaches as wrap-around display screens, actual rooms augmented with wearable computers, and haptics devices that let you feel the display images.\n\n### Virtual reality can be divided into:\n\nThe simulation of a real environment for training and education.\nThe development of an imagined environment for a game or interactive story.\n\nExplore more about Virtual Reality by reading these articles.\n* In simple English : [Choose me](https://kids.kiddle.co/Virtual_reality)\n* In medium English : [Click me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality)\n* In advance English : [Click here](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-virtual-reality/)\n\n## Tips \nIf you don't understand any word please google it.\n","submissionType":null,"githubLink":"https://github.com/navgurukul/newton/tree/master/technical-readings-101/virtual-reality.md"}
