The researcher is concerned because all patients seemingly have unusual and identical BMIs, despite having different physiques. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres.\r\n\r\nUse the debugging principles in this exercise and locate problems with the code. What suggestions would you give the researcher for ensuring any later changes they make work correctly?\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\npatients = [[70, 1.8], [80, 1.9], [150, 1.7]]\r\n\r\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\r\n    return weight / (height ** 2)\r\n\r\nfor patient in patients:\r\n    weight, height = patients[0]\r\n    bmi = calculate_bmi(height, weight)\r\n    print(\"Patient's BMI is: %f\" % bmi)\r\n```\r\n\r\nJab aapka program theek ho jayega, toh uska output yeh hoga:\r\n\r\nPatient's BMI is: 21.604938\r\nPatient's BMI is: 22.160665\r\nPatient's BMI is: 51.903114     ","submissionType":null,"githubLink":"https://github.com/navgurukul/newton/tree/master/bas-ek-galti/bmi.md"}
