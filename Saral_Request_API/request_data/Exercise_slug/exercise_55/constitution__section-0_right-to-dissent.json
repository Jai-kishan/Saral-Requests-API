For the sake of efficiency, usually the contrarian views are handled with contempt while **dissent** and **whistleblowing** are seen as acts of distraction. NavGurukul's constitution believes that in the interest of fairness and long-term growth, dissent and whistleblowing are important and valuable parts of the system. Hence, constitution gives every member a \"right to dissent\" where the member can directly raise a concern which needs to be addressed by the Council in presence of the Board of the Governors. Members are encouraged to actively exercise their dissent and **expose loopholes** in the systems.\n\nOur constitution salutes all the Whistleblowers that have helped the World in becoming a better place.\n\n","submissionType":null,"githubLink":"https://github.com/navgurukul/newton/tree/master/constitution/section-0/right-to-dissent.md"}
