It is important that each and every member of the facility feels **empowered** by the constitution and the **elected members** act as **facilitators** rather than as power centers.

Hence, each member is encouraged to participate and take ownership.\n","submissionType":null,"githubLink":"https://github.com/navgurukul/newton/tree/master/constitution/section-0/section-0.md"}
