Students need to responsibly manage and govern the residential facility to ensure that\n- there is a space for each and every student to use this opportunity to hone their **leadership** skills and attitude and learn to take charge of the situations\n- students are able to **own up** and contribute to the various processes and realise their larger role in shaping their own experiences and learning\n- the model is **scalable** to plug and play more NavGurukuls leading to more and more students to benefit from this\n\nThere are many hiccups that come in the way of a smoothly running system. It needs people to take ownership and set things right. This constitution provides a framework to work in a structured manner - leading to growth of every member while efficiently tackling the problem that may arise on a day-to-day basis.\n\nYou can use this opportunity to understand and appreciate your own role to create a **safe space** that prospers learning and love amongst all. \nMay this constitution and every effort that we make:\n\n**असतो मा साद गमय, तमसो मा ज्योतिर् गमय, मृत्योर मा अमृतम् गमय**\n\nLead us from ignorance to truth, Lead us from darkness to light, Lead us from death to deathlessness.\n\n","submissionType":null,"githubLink":"https://github.com/navgurukul/newton/tree/master/constitution/navgurukul-constitution.md"}
